The concept: subscription-based platform where users get 2-for-1 deals at partner restaurants. Use a sophisticated color palette with emerald green (#10b981, #059669), coral/orange (#f97316, #ea580c) for appetite appeal, cream/beige (#fef3c7, #fde68a) for elegance, and dark gray (#1f2937, #111827) for professionalism. Design must feel premium, modern, and NOT AI-generated - use creative layouts, asymmetric elements, and sophisticated typography. Include: 1) Hero section with compelling headline about saving money at restaurants, dual CTAs (See Restaurants / View Plans), 2) Benefits section with 4 cards explaining advantages (2-for-1 meals, valid at best restaurants, unlimited experiences, quick ROI), 3) How it works section with 4 interactive steps, 4) Testimonials section with 3 customer reviews, 5) Newsletter signup section, 6) Full navigation with mobile menu. Make it persuasive, conversion-focused, and visually striking. Use modern CSS techniques, smooth animations, and professional spacing.
